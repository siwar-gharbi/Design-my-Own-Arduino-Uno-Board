# -Design-my-Own-Arduino-Uno-Board-
Designed an Arduino electronic board using Altium Designer, involving component selection, schematic creation, printed circuit board routing, and generation of manufacturing files. Throughout this project, I gained proficiency in:

- Drawing schematics with strategies for component selection and critical circuit considerations.
- Creating components, drafting schematic symbols, and designing footprints.
- Placing components onto the PCB.
- Routing the PCB, incorporating layout optimization best practices.
- Generating a 3D model to visualize the board's physical structure.
- Crafting a comprehensive Bill of Materials (BOM) for component procurement.
- Generating assembly drawings detailing component placement on the board.
- Generating manufacturing files such as Gerber, Pick and Place, and Drill files.
- Preparing professional documentation required for PCB manufacturing and board assembly.

# Summary 
1. Creating my own libraries (schematics, footprints and adding a 3D model to each component).
2. Components placement.
3. Layer's stackup.
4. PCB Layout & Routing.
5. 3D model.
6. Gerber files, mechanical and assembly drawing.
